Java RPC with AES Encryption
This project implements a Java Remote Procedure Call (RPC) system secured with AES encryption, ensuring encrypted communication between client and server.

Features:
RPC Framework: Enables remote method calls between client and server.
AES Encryption: Encrypts data on the client side and decrypts on the server side for secure transmission.
Java-Based: Simple, platform-independent implementation in Java.

Setup:
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/FatimaBouyarmane/RPC-Encrypt-Decrypt.git
